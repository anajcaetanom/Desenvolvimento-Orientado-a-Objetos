# Object-Oriented Development – Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains practical implementations of **Design Patterns** studied during the *Object-Oriented Development* (Desenvolvimento Orientado a Objetos - DOO) course.

The goal of these implementations was to explore reusable solutions to common software design problems using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

## ⚙️ Creational Design Patterns  

- 🏭 **Factory**

---

## ✅ Behavioral Design Patterns  

- 🔁 **Chain of Responsibility**  
- 📝 **Command**  
- 🧠 **Interpreter**  
- 🔄 **Iterator**  
- 🗣️ **Mediator**  
- 🧳 **Memento**  
- 👁️ **Observer**  
- 🎭 **State**  
- 🧩 **Strategy**  
- 📋 **Template Method**  
- 🚶‍♂️ **Visitor**

---

## 🏗️ Structural Design Patterns  

- 🔌 **Adapter**
- 🌉 **Bridge**
- 🌲 **Composite**
- 🎁 **Decorator**
- 🏛️ **Facade**
- 🪶 **Flyweight**
- 🛡️ **Proxy**

---

Each pattern is implemented in its own folder and demonstrates a practical use case to reinforce understanding of object-oriented design principles like **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.

> This project was part of my academic journey in learning how to build robust and scalable systems using clean code and reusable architectures.
